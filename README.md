 Expression Tree & Rectangle Builder in Java
This project provides a comprehensive implementation in Java for building, parsing, exporting, and visualizing expression trees and rectangular structures from formulas or text-based inputs. It integrates recursive algorithms, backtracking, and GUI components using Java Swing and AWT.

 Features
Expression Tree Construction from textual formulas using recursive descent parsing.

Export and Import of tree structures to and from both text formulas and graphical representations.

Rectangle Formation Logic using trial-and-error with backtracking to verify if a set of nodes can form a valid rectangle.

General â†” Binary Tree Conversions with visual printing and export support.

Tree Visualization GUI allowing user interaction to draw and manipulate both binary and general trees.

Tree Operations such as adding/deleting leaves, counting nodes, and rotating drawn trees.

 Technologies Used
Java (Core)

Java Swing / AWT (for GUI)

Recursive algorithms, DFS, Backtracking

 Requirements
Java JDK 8+

Any Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse)

 How to Run
 
Open the project in your IDE.

Run the Main class.

Use the GUI to interact with trees and structures.
